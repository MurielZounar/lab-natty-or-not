# 🐍 Python Learning Guide — AI-Assisted Web Page

## 📒 Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly Python learning guide presented as a single-page web application.  
The content is organized into modular chapters to enhance readability and learning flow.

## 🤖 Technologies Used
- Google Gemini  
- ChatGPT

## 🛠️ How It Was Built
The initial idea was to create an eBook with practical Python tips. To generate the content, I used ChatGPT, then reviewed and edited the material.  
After that, I used Google Gemini to structure the content as a formatted document.

Originally, I planned to use a third AI to convert the document into an eBook. But to my surprise, Gemini suggested generating a web page instead — and I accepted.

Throughout the process, Gemini pointed out code and formatting issues and prompted me to correct them. I approved all suggestions, which made the development smoother and faster.

## 💭 Reflection
This project showed me how AI can significantly speed up the development process.  
Creating a similar web page from scratch — given my current skill set — would have taken several days. With AI, I completed it in about **30 minutes**.

Used properly, AI is not just a tool — it's a powerful collaborator.
